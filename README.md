# Iodine üê¢

This is a realtime viewer for Halite 3 games. This is *work in progress*.

* You will need Electron
* You will need a copy of the *[dubnium engine](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/dubnium)* (a clone of Halite 3)
* Tell the viewer where *dubnium* is in `settings.json`
* The recommended setup is to have the *iodine* directory inside your halite folder
* Then you can do `electron  ./iodine  bot.exe  "python somebot.py"  -s 123  --width 32  --height 32`
* Tell me if it works
