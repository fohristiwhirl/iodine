# Iodine üê¢

This is a realtime viewer for Halite 3 games.

* You will need Electron
* You will need a copy of the *[dubnium engine](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/dubnium)* (a clone of Halite 3)
* Tell the viewer where *dubnium* is in `settings.json`
* The recommended setup is to have the *iodine* directory inside your halite folder
* Then you can do `electron ./iodine bot.exe "python somebot.py" -s 123 --width 32 --height 32`
* Tell me if it works
